# StepperChecker

StepperChecker is  a stepper motor driver dev and test board, designed to be easy to build, setup, and use.
It will take any stepstick style motor driver and any Feather compatible microcontroller board.
The basic intent is to have firmware loaded that will move the motor forward or reverse based on which button is pressed, at a sped defined by the potentiometer. But, of course, the sky is the limit given the many Feather boards available.
